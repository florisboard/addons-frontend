# About

We are a team of passionate developers committed to enhancing user experience while prioritizing privacy. Our latest project is an open-source keyboard designed specifically for Android users who value their data security and privacy. This keyboard is currently in its early beta stage, undergoing rigorous testing and development to ensure it meets our high standards of quality and functionality.

Our mission is to provide a seamless typing experience that doesn't compromise on user privacy. We believe that every individual has the right to keep their data secure and private. Therefore, we have developed a keyboard that not only offers a smooth and efficient typing interface but also ensures that all data remains confidential and under the control of the user.
